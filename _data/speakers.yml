  surname: "Gregory"
  bio: "Kate Gregory has been using C++ since before Microsoft had a C++ compiler, and has been paid to program since 1979. She loves C++ and believes that software should make our lives easier. That includes making the lives of developers easier! She'll stay up late arguing about deterministic destruction or how modern C++ is not the C++ you remember. Kate runs a small consulting firm in rural Ontario and provides mentoring and management consultant services, as well as writing code every week. She has spoken all over the world, written over a dozen books, and helped thousands of developers to be better at what they do.

  name: "Odin"
  surname: "Olmes"
  bio: "Odin was allocated from a pool of hippies in the middle of the forest. He spent most of his career designing electronic circuits and programming micro controllers in assembler. One day after having shot himself in the foot particularly badly a friend introduced him to C++, a seriously powerful and ongoing addiction followed. Odin has authored many proof of concept libraries in the embedded field and is trying to revolutionize this domain. Odin co-authored the kvasir::mpl library, co-founded the embo.io conference and was a heavy contributor to the brigand library. In his day job, he teaches people how to shoot themselves in the foot less and get more from their compiler, both with his in-house team as well as in a training and consulting role."

  surname: "Macrae"
  bio: "Clare has worked in software development for over 30 years, and in C++ for 20 years.<p/>Since 2017, she has used her spare time to work remotely with Llewellyn Falco on <a href=\"https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp\">ApprovalTests.cpp</a>, to radically simplify testing of legacy code. She has enjoyed this so much that she recently went independent, to focus even more on helping others to work more easily with legacy code.<p/>Clare was until recently a Principal Scientific Software Engineer at Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, which releases structural data and powerful software for scientific education, research, and streamlining the design and manufacture of new medicines.<p/>From 2016 to 2018, she lead the team that replaced their 30 year old database format and Fortran code. She then returned to C++ and Qt, working on the popular 3D crystal structure visualisation program <a href=\"https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/mercury\">Mercury</a>, which she was the original author of.<p/>When not thinking about supporting teams to streamline development, testing and releases, she spends time with family and friends, and enjoys the Raspberry Pi, folk music and cinema."
