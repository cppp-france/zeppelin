Have you been thinking about giving a talk at a C++ conference?

We opened the call for proposals for CPPP: <https://cppp.fr/cfp/>

Whether you are a seasoned speaker or it is the first time you think about it, you can propose a talk. You can contact us at [presentation@cppp.fr](mailto:presentation@cppp.fr) if you feel unsure and want some help writing the proposal.

You have until 29th of February 2020 to write your proposal, but don't hesitate to send it earlier.

#### Any questions?
