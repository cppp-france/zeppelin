We are glad to announce that CPPP will return bigger in 2020!

#### June 22 and 23 2020

The 2020 edition will be two days, with the three tracks that were already present in the first edition: "Progress", "Produce" and "Push Forward".

Given the positive feedback from 2019, we'll be coming back to the UIC-P and you will once again see the Eiffel Tower from your seats while listening to the talks!

This year's talks will be selected through a Call for Submissions that should take place early 2020. We'll announce the actual timeline as soon as we have it.
