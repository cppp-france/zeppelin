#### A unique opportunity

Whether you are actively recruiting or just want to create links with the C++ community and work on your image, sponsoring conferences is an incredible opportunity for companies and organizations working with the C++ community. CPPP offers different kind of partnership depending on how you want to reach developers.

##### Sponsoring

Sponsoring the conference is a great way to improve your visibility in the C++ world. We offer three levels of sponsorship, from bronze to gold, with increasing involvement and visibility from both the attendees and people following the conference.

##### Exhibiting

Exhibiting is the right approach if you want to meet the attendees. You can choose to have a table or a full booth. Given the size and shape of the venue, the exhibitors have a great visibility and are visible to all the attendees.

##### Custom Partnership

CPPP is open to custom partnerships, like sponsoring meals, student tickets, videos, etc. Each of these partnership are unique and can be discussed with the CPPP organization team. They can give you a great deal of visibility and be the occasion of passing a message to the attendees.
